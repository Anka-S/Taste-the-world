                <h4 class="japan">Japanese</h4>
                <p>Japanese food culture has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, influenced by its geography, climate, and social structures. The early Japanese diet was heavily based on rice, fish, and vegetables, with rice becoming a staple diet during the Yayoi period (300 BCE â€“ 300 CE) as wet-rice cultivation spread across the country.</p>
                <p>The introduction of Buddhism in the 6th century led to a decline in meat consumption, reinforcing a diet focused on fish and plant-based foods, a tradition that continues to influence Japanese cuisine today.</p>
                <p>The Edo period (1603-1868) brought significant changes to Japanese food culture with the rise of urban centers like Edo (modern-day Tokyo). Street food vendors and the emergence of specialized restaurants made food more accessible to common people.</p>
                <p> Sushi, tempura, and other dishes that are now synonymous with Japanese cuisine began to take shape during this time. Additionally, the development of new cooking techniques and the introduction of ingredients like sweet potatoes and peppers from abroad diversified the Japanese diet</p>

                 <h4 class="ukraine">Ukrainian</h4>
                 <p>Ukrainian food culture is a testament to its agrarian roots and diverse historical influences. Central to Ukrainian cuisine are hearty, comforting dishes that reflect the country's agricultural abundance. Staples such as borscht, a beet soup often enriched with meat and vegetables,</p>
                 <p> and varenyky, dumplings filled with potatoes, cheese, or fruit, are beloved nationwide. Bread, especially in the form of pampushky (garlic bread rolls) and korovai (decorative wedding bread), holds symbolic importance in Ukrainian traditions, representing hospitality and celebration.</p>
                 <p>Seasonal and regional variations also play a significant role in Ukrainian culinary practices. In the western regions, Hungarian and Polish influences are evident in dishes like banush (cornmeal with bacon and cheese), while the southern areas show traces of Turkish and Tatar cuisines.</p>
                 <p> Festive occasions bring out an array of special dishes, such as kutia (a sweet grain pudding) for Christmas and pysanky (decorated eggs) for Easter. These culinary traditions not only showcase Ukraine's rich agricultural heritage but also its resilience and adaptability through centuries of change.</p>

                     <h4 class="morocco">Moroccan</h4>
                     <p>The arrival of the Arabs in the 7th century had a profound impact on Moroccan cuisine, bringing with them new spices, fruits, and cooking techniques. The Arab influence introduced the use of exotic spices such as cinnamon, saffron, and cumin,</p>
                     <p>as well as the practice of combining sweet and savory flavors, which is a hallmark of Moroccan dishes today. The Arabs also brought the tradition of communal eating, with meals often centered around large platters shared by family and friends.</p>
                     <p>In the modern era, Moroccan food culture continues to evolve, reflecting both its storied past and contemporary influences. The country's markets, or souks, are vibrant hubs where the legacy of diverse culinary traditions can be seen and tasted.</p>
                     <p>From street food vendors to high-end restaurants, Moroccan cuisine remains a dynamic and integral part of the nation's cultural identity, celebrated for its bold flavors, aromatic spices, and communal dining experiences.</p>
