                        <p>First of all, one of the major places in Ukrainian cuisine takes grain and vegetable-based
                            dishes, which is obviously not a surprise, as Ukraine is a world agricultural leader. We use
                            quality ingredients carefully grown on our fields and farms to make our food especially
                            rich, tasteful, and healthy. 
                            <br>
                            Secondly, we use diverse techniques practiced throughout our entire history. Cold Ukrainian
                            winters made the nation experiment with the cooking processes and led to the development of
                            drying, curing, pickling, salting, and smoking technologies. 
                            <br>
                            And thirdly, there can be hundreds of different Ukrainian recipes for one dish. The way of
                            cooking differs from region to region, and each family usually has its own formula for a
                            delicious dish. You can often alter the recipe to make it vegetarian, vegan, or
                            pescatarian. 
                            The most famous traditional Ukrainian dishes are <strong><ahref="#borshch">borshch</a></strong>,

                            and it surely is not an exhaustive list. </p>

                        <p>Borshch (sometimes written as borsch, borsht, bortsch, or borshch) is a sour soup with
                            distinctive red colour. Usually, the ingredients are meat, beetroots, cabbage, carrots,
                            onions, potatoes, and tomatoes. It can be served either hot or cold, and it can also be
                            white or green, depending on the ingredients. It is traditionally done with smetana
                            (sour cream), pampushky (tiny garlic buns), garlic, onion, and salo (pork lard).
                            <br>As we mentioned, borshch has many variations. And you can make it totally vegeterian,
                            without any meat and sour cream.</p>

                            <li>To make the stock, put the meat, whole onion, bay leaf and 2 litres of lightly salted cold
                            water in a large saucepan. Cook over a very low heat for 1 hr 30 mins or until the beef shin
                            is soft and falls apart easily – this can take up to 3 hrs. Skim off the scum with a spoon
                            from time to time. Break up any larger pieces of beef into the broth, remove the whole onion
                            and discard.</li>

                            <li> Add the potatoes to the borscht, season well with salt and pepper and cook for 10-15 mins
                            until tender. Meanwhile, heat the sunflower oil in a large, deep frying pan. Add the diced
                            onion and carrot, and cook over a medium heat, stirring, until the carrot is soft and is
                            about to start caramelising.</li>
   
                            <li>Add the beetroot and cook for around 5 mins, stirring occasionally. Add the red pepper, if
                            using, and cook for another 2 mins, then add the tomatoes, stir, then increase
                            the heat and boil to reduce slightly, before adding everything to the borscht.</li>
                            
                            <li>Add the shredded cabbage and the kidney beans, and cook for 7-10 mins or until tender. Serve
                            with a dollop of sour cream or crème fraîche, lots of chopped dill and some crusty bread.</li>
