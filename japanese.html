                        <p>Curry rice is considered one of Japan's national dishes and loved by Japanese people of all ages. Adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy to help prevent thiamine deficiency, it has stuck around and adapted to Japanese tastes — to the point where it became one of the most common school cafeteria meals and is said to be eaten by Japanese folks at least once a week. One of the reasons why Japanese curry rice is loved all over the world is due to the fact that flavors and toppings can be varied and evolve into “curry rice” that is unique to each area.</p>
                        <p> This particular recipe takes tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich, savory curry sauce - this version of kare raisu is a must-have for your family meal. For a vegetarian alternative swap out the chicken for some king oyster mushrooms, aubergine and asparagus and follow the vegetarian recipe below.</p>

                        <br>
                        <ol class="ordered-list">

                            <li>Heat 1½ tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir the onions too often because they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so we do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes, definitely caramelize the onions!</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger and mix well together. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock and half water. Add the grated apple, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp soy sauce, and 1 tbsp ketchup.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes. The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Simmer, covered, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth. Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.</li>
                            <br>
                            <h4>To add the curry roux</h4><br>
                            <li>Turn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn.</li><br>
                            <h4>To serve</h4><br>
                            <li>Serve the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke.</li>

                        <p>Varenyky are Ukrainian national dish that is not inferior in popularity and importance even
                            to borscht. Varenyky are made from fresh dough and a variety of fillings, such as meat,
                            potatoes, mushrooms, vegetables, fruits, cheese and many more. Their fillings can be salty
                            or sweet, lean or meaty. Recipes vary greatly depending on the region.</p>
                        <p>
                            Varenyky also have important folklore and even magical significance. Ukrainian ancestors
                            invested great symbolism in this dish. The shape of the varenyky resembles the new moon, so
                            the dish was used as a sacrificial offering. The process of kneading the dough was
                            identified with the origin of the universe, and the filling symbolized the continuation of
                            the genus.
                        <p>Dumplings were a must-have dish at important events. For example, girls brought
                            varenyky to recently delivered women. People ate this dish also when the cow was calving to
                            keep the calf healthy. Varenyky were eaten during the harvest, while people believed that
                            this food should give inspiration and strength to the reapers.</p>

                            <li>Savory dumplings can also be made with potatoes and mushrooms, only with mushrooms,
                                cabbage or liver. Sweet dumplings are often made with cottage cheese, cherries,
                                strawberries and some other less popular fillings.</li><br>
                            <li>Speaking of filling, do not overstuff the dumplings. This will make closing them harder.
                                If the dough is not properly sealed/pinched shut they can break open in the boiling

                        <br>
                        <ol class="ordered-list">

                            <li>Pour warm water (not boiling water, it should be about 38 degrees) into a deep mixing
                                bowl. Add flour and salt.
                                2 cups all-purpose flour,1 cup warm water,1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>

                            <li> Knead the dough first with a spoon and then with your hands until you get a soft
                                elastic dough that is a little sticky when touching it. Alternatively, you can also use
                                a stand mixer. Cover the ball of dough with cling film and let it rest for 30 minutes.
                            </li>

                            <li>While the dough is resting, cut the peeled potatoes into small cubes and put them in a
                                saucepan. Add water and a pinch of salt and boil the potatoes until soft. Then drain all
                                the water.</li>

                            <li>AIn a frying pan, fry the chopped onion in butter until golden brown, stirring
                                occasionally. This should take around 5-6 minutes. If you don't like onions, feel free
                                to omit them.
                                1 yellow onion,2 tablespoons butter</li>
                            <li>Mash the boiled potatoes with a potato masher or a fork. Then add the fried onions, salt
                                and pepper. If you see that the potatoes are too dry, add a little bit of milk or warm
                                water until they have a soft, slightly creamy consistency.
                                1/3 teaspoon salt,1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                            <li>Once the dough has rested, it will be even softer. It will be easier to work with and it
                                should not stick to your hands. However, it may stick a little to the table so sprinkle
                                it with a little bit of flour. Then cut off half of the dough and roll it out until it’s
                                very thin, approximately 1-2 mm. Next, using a glass or cup, cut out circles about 3
                                inches in diameter.</li>
                            <li>On the edge of each of the circles, put a teaspoon of potato and onion filling (don't
                                add too much filling!).</li>
                            <li>Cover the filling by folding the dough over and pinch the edges closed. You can pinch
                                the edges using your thumb and index finger or with a fork.</li>
                            <li>Gather the leftover dough not cut into circles and add it to the other half of the
                                dough. Roll it out and repeat the steps until you have used up all the dough and
                                filling. Now the varenyky are ready for boiling.</li>
                            <li>Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan or pot. Lightly salt it (2 pinches of salt to
                                3 cups of water), then add the dumplings to the water and wait until they float to the
                                top. After they float, boil for 2 more minutes. If your pot is not very large, you might
                                have to cook the varenyky in batches.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the hot dumplings to a bowl and add a little bit of butter (optional). When it
                                melts on the surface of the hot dumplings, gently stir them so as not to tear the dough,
                                and that each dumpling is greased with butter. This way they won't stick together.</li>

                            <li>Transfer the dumplings to a plate, sprinkle with chopped herbs if desired, and serve.
